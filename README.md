🚦 Crossing Game

🕹️ Project Overview
Welcome to the Crossing Game!
In this fun Python project, you control a player character and try to cross a busy screen full of moving obstacles.
Each successful crossing makes the game faster and more challenging!
The project was created as part of my journey to practice Python basics, OOP, and game development using the built-in turtle graphics module.
